        Arsenal Football Club was born when a group of workers at Dial Square armaments factory in Woolwich, notably exiled Scotsman 
        David Danskin and Jack Humble, decided to form a football team to break the monotony of factory life.
        Since that Dial Square team played its first match against Eastern Wanderers in 1886, Arsenal has gone on to become one of 
        Londonâ€™s most successful football clubs and one of the most famous names in modern football with millions of passionate followers 
        worldwide.
     Steeped in history and tradition, Arsenal Football Club has thrived on a pioneering and innovative spirit that has 
     existed throughout its 125 years in existence. While society and football may have changed during this time, 
     Arsenal has always served to create a sense of community for people here in Islington, across the UK and 
     now around the world.
